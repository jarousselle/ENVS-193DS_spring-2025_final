### a.Transparent statistical methods

In part 1, they used a linear regression. In part 2, they used an ANOVA test.

In addition, they should also include the results of $\eta^2$ test to show the effect size, or the proportion of variation in the response that is explained by the predictor variable. 

### c. Suggestions for rewriting
